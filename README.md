# PhotonTimeLapse

Time lapse of a few SLA prints I did using Anycubic Photon. The time lapse was made by pausing the print at equal intervals by using a custom software that communicate with the printer over the ethernet port. The software also communicate with a  Cannon EOS T1i to take the picture.
